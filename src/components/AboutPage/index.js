            <p className='about-para'>The One Shop is an exclusive online store for return gifts and corporate gifts, founded in the year 2014. As part of our <br/> product category, we bring to you an exclusive collection of Indian Handicrafts and Handlooms – suitable for gifting.</p>
            <p className='about-para'>The vision of The One Shop is to make it a hassle free experience for Indians worldwide to buy high quality crafts as <br/> gifts for any occasion, and get them delivered to their door step.</p>
            <p className='about-para'>The conventional way to buy gifts has been to go to the local wholesale markets, which takes a lot of effort and time. <br/> In today’s world, the most scarce resource for anyone is time. In the era of ecommerce people can buy online, but <br/> it’s the question of quality and reliability. Furthermore, how do you ensure the gift you give your guests or associates <br/> reflects your taste and personality? That’s where The One Shop came into existence, offering exclusive and unique <br/> gifting options which are curated by our experts, clubbed with a variety of personalisation options to choose from, <br/> and a stringent quality check process where every piece gets checked prior to dispatch.</p>
            <p className='about-para'>While serving this objective, we also aim to provide a boost to the artisans and weavers in different pockets of India, <br/> by providing them market access through our predictable customer demand. We directly source from the artisans <br/> and manufacturers across India. The One Shop uses a combination of technology, best management practises, <br/> supply chain and customer service to enhance the experience of both its customers and suppliers, while maximising <br/> the value for all stakeholders. This will ensure that only the best quality products are delivered to our customers on <br/> time.</p>
            <p className='about-para'>The One Shop is headquartered in Hyderabad, India and serves the customers worldwide. Anyone can order from <br/> our website <a href='/'>www.thegiftshopshop.in</a> and the products will get delivered to their door step through our logistics <br/> partners.</p>
